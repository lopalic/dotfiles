# Dotifiles

The dotfiles that I prefer using for vim and tmux when doing work.
They add some useful highlighting and shortcuts for Rails projects.

# Prerequisites

Install [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/powerline/raw/develop/font/PowerlineSymbols.otf).

Rerun PlugInstall if something fails once running vim.
